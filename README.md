# AoC_23
Advent of Code 2023 Scripts

## D01 - Trebuchet?!
Challenge 1:
- Fun number extraction from string task.
- RegEx quickly solves single digit number identification.

Challenge 2:
- Increased difficulty due combined digit and word search in string.
- Crux: overlapping words have to be accounted for -> **New-to-me concept:** introduction to the RegEx concept of [positive lookahead](https://www.regextutorial.org/positive-and-negative-lookahead-assertions.php#:~:text=Positive%20lookahead%3A,it%20simply%20rejects%20that%20match.) -> very useful.


## D02 - Cube Conundrum
Challenge 1:
- Simple but actually surprisingly time-consuming number comparison task.

Challenge 2:
- If Challenge 1 has been set up elegantly, this is very simple: replace comparison operation with `max()` identification
- **New-to-me tool:** `from functools import reduce`, quickly apply operation on all elements of a list "bundled up" -> very powerful little function.


## D03 - Gear Ratios
Challenge 1:
- S

Challenge 2:
- I
