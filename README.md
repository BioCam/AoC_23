## D01 - Trebuchet?!
Part 1:
- Fun number extraction from string task.
- RegEx quickly solves single digit number identification.

Part 2:
- Increased difficulty due combined digit and word search in string.
- Crux: overlapping words have to be accounted for -> **New-to-me concept:** introduction to the RegEx concept of [positive lookahead](https://www.regextutorial.org/positive-and-negative-lookahead-assertions.php#:~:text=Positive%20lookahead%3A,it%20simply%20rejects%20that%20match.) -> very useful.

Part 1:
- Simple but actually surprisingly time-consuming number comparison task.

Part 2:
- If Challenge 1 has been set up elegantly, this is very simple: replace comparison operation with `max()` identification

## D03 - Gear Ratios
Part 1:
- 2D operations

Part 2:
- If Cha
